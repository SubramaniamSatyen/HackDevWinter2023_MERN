# HackDevWinter2023_MERN
This repo stores the code for my Hack Dev project exploring using Gatsby as a static site with the MERN tech stack. The static site showcases some of my projects and work at the time of its creation.

# Developing Locally
1. Clone the repo
2. Define the correct connection string in the DATABASE_URL variable and ensure `server/server.js` can access it
4. Navigate to `/server` directory and run `npm start`
5. In a new terminal navigate to `client` and run `gatsby develop`
6. View the application at `localhost:8000` in your browser
